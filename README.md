# GroupMe Bot

# Description
This is a GroupMe bot that utilizes the API of GroupMe and Google Sheets to help students and student managers organize available shifts. By reading the messages in the group chat, the bot looks for commands and accordingly updates a Google sheet that is available to anyone with the link.
It is currently deployed on Heroku.

bot.py is the file that is deployed on Heroku.\
bot_local.py is the file that I can run locally if I want to make and test changes.

# Inspiration
Student managers at Sodexo use the popular app, GroupMe, to communicate with student workers regarding available shifts.
Vice versa, student workers use the app to announce shifts that they want covered and accept shifts that are available.
With over 50 students in a single GroupMe group it can be difficult to see what shifts are open and the coverages.

# History 
I've been working on this since January 2019 but I created a new repository because of sensitive information that was being displayed in the commit history.
